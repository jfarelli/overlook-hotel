### Setting Up: <a name="setup"></a>

* Clone down the repo by clicking the green **Code** button, and then copying the link under **SSH**.
* In your terminal, type in `git clone` and then paste the copied link.
* Once you have cloned the repo, change ( `cd` ) into the directory and install the project dependencies, by running `npm install`.
* Run `npm start` in the terminal, and copy the URL link (`http://localhost:8080/`) to see the HTML page 
* Now that you have that visit this [GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api) and clone it down into a seperate folder outside of the one you previously cloned.
* Then, CD into the folder and run `npm install` and then `npm start`
* No need to copy and paste an address for this.
* The website should be functioning now!
* To stop running the server, use Control + C in the terminal. (Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.)
